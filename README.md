Employee Form Using JsonPowerDB
Description

This is a simple employee form made with HTML, Bootstrap and JavaScript. It lets you add new employees, check if an employee already exists by ID, update their details, and reset the form. All the data is stored in JsonPowerDB using its REST API. The idea is to show how easy it is to connect a webpage directly to JPDB without any backend server.
